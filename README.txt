Easily accept cryptocurrency payments on your WordPress Ecommerce store. No redirecting to 3rd party intermediaries. Non-custodial. No merchant fees.

== Description ==

The Pip Checkout cryptocurrency gateway for WooCommerce makes it simple for your online store to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Veil and Digitbyte on WordPress. Simply install and activate the plugin, paste in your wallet address(es) and click Save. You're now ready for peer to peer decentralised payments, that are 100% non-custodial, with no merchant fees, and no middlemen. 

Pip Checkout's WordPress plugin also removes the need to redirect your customers to a 3rd party site to complete payment. Everything takes place on your site thanks to our <a href="https://docs.pip.cash">PipTX API</a> for generating quotes. Our algorithm ensures that you can easily match each order to its corresponding payment. The information used for POST request is amount, currency and wallet address(es), as detailed in the <a href="https://docs.pip.cash">API documentation.</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do if error message "Merchant has not configured their receiving address" is shown? =
If you are the merchant, ensure you have correctly entered a receiving address for at least one cryptocurrency type.
If you are the customer, please contact the merchant to let them know in case they are unaware.

= Can I change the Payment Method label and description? =
Of course, you can easily customise these at WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Pip Checkout

= How does Pip Checkout ensure that I can match payments with orders? =
Our API called PipTX houses an algorithm that ensures no quotes generated within a 15 minute sliding window are duplicates. This modifier is applied as the lowest possible decimal level to ensure no impact is seen on the USD (or whatever default currency) amount.
